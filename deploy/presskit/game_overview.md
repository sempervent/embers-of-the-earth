## Description

In Embers of the Earth, players inherit a farm in a post-apocalyptic world where machines and nature war beneath the earth. Every action echoes through generations: plant the same crop repeatedly, and the soil resents you. Break a faction contract, and NPCs remember for generations. Push entropy toward Order or Wild, and shape the ending.

### Key Features

- **Soil Memory System**: Every tile remembers your choices. Neglect soil health, and yields decline.
- **Generational Succession**: When you die, control passes to an heir. Traits, heirlooms, and shame echo across generations.
- **Dual-Path Entropy**: Push toward Order (machines) or Wild (nature). Reach 75% on either path → ending triggers.
- **Faction Diplomacy**: Marriages seal alliances. Contracts are permanent. Shame persists.
- **Procedural Storytelling**: No scripted story. The story emerges from player choices, NPC memories, rumors, and world events.

## Target Audience
