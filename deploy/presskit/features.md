# Embers of the Earth - Features

## Core Features

### Soil Memory System

Every tile remembers your choices: crops planted, years used, mood (content → resentful → exhausted). Rotate crops to maintain soil health, or face declining yields.

### Generational Succession

When you die, control passes to an heir. Traits, heirlooms, and reputation echo across generations. NPCs remember your grandfather's broken contract.

### Dual-Path Entropy

Two futures war beneath the earth: Order (machines) and Wild (nature). Your actions push the meter. Reach 75% on either path → ending triggers.

### Faction Diplomacy

Marriages seal faction alliances. Contracts include dowries, obligations, and benefits. Break a contract → shame echoes through generations.

### Procedural Storytelling

No scripted story. The story emerges from player choices, NPC memories, rumors, and world events. Each playthrough tells a different tale.
