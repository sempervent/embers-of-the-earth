## At a Glance

This guide walks you through your first seven days in Embers of the Earth. From character creation to your first harvest, you'll learn the fundamentals while establishing your legacy.

---

## Your First Session

### 1. Character Creation

**Title Screen** → Press any key → **Main Menu** → **New Game**

#### Choose Your Family

- **First Name**: Your character's personal name
- **Family Name**: Your bloodline's surname (becomes part of the world)
- **Two Traits**: Choose one blessing + one flaw/origin
  - *Example*: Ironblood (blessing) + Oathbreaker Heir (flaw)
- **Origin**: Machine-Aligned, Nature-Aligned, Exiled Refugees, or Neutral
- **Starting Heirloom**: Choose one heirloom to begin your legacy

#### World Impact Preview

As you select traits, preview how they affect:
- **Faction Opinions**: Which factions will like/hate you
- **Soil Affinity**: Which soil types favor your playstyle
- **NPC Memories**: Starting reputation with named characters

**Recommendation**: Read trait descriptions carefully. Each choice shapes your entire playthrough.

---

### 2. Prologue

**"First Winter Letter"** cinematic plays automatically.

The letter from the First Farmer sets the tone:
> *"The earth remembers. Every seed planted, every harvest taken. The machine-god sleeps beneath, but the soil holds our history. Tend it well."*

**No action required**: Watch the sequence, let the atmosphere sink in.

---

### 3. First Day (Day 1)

#### Morning: Examine Your Farm

- **Farm Grid**: 10×10 tile field (empty initially)
- **Player Position**: Start at farm gate
- **Inventory**: Check starting items (varies by traits/origin)

#### Noon: Till Your First Tile

1. Stand on an empty tile
2. Press **E** to till soil
3. Tile becomes tillable (dark brown)
4. **Soil Type**: Check tile info (hover or inspect)

**[FIELD NOTE]**

*Soil types have machine/nature affinity. Ferro-soil favors biomechanical crops. Pure bio-soil favors biological crops. Plant accordingly.*

#### Evening: Plant Your First Crop

1. Stand on tilled tile
2. Press **E** → Select crop from menu
3. Choose **Steamroot** (easy starter crop)
4. Crop planted (green sprout appears)

**Check Crop Info**:
- Growth stages: 4
- Days per stage: 4
- Total time: 16 days until harvest

---

### 4. Days 2-7: Establish Routine

#### Day 2-3: Expand Your Farm

- Till 2-3 more tiles
- Plant diverse crops (avoid monoculture)
- **Important**: Plant different crops on different tiles

#### Day 4-5: First Settlement Visit

1. Open map (press **M**)
2. Select **Brassford** (nearest settlement)
3. Confirm travel (costs: 5 days, 5 food, 2 fuel)
4. Travel screen shows progress
5. **Encounter**: 30% chance for random event

**If Encounter Triggers**:
- Read description
- Choose action (pay, flee, negotiate, fight)
- Stat tests determine success/failure
- Effects applied (resource loss, injury, time delay)

**[FIELD NOTE]**

*Travel encounters are choice-based, not action combat. Your stats (Resolve, Diplomacy, Vigor) determine outcomes. Choose wisely.*

#### Day 6: First Trade

1. Arrive at settlement
2. Open trade menu
3. Browse items:
   - **Sells**: Items you can buy
   - **Buys**: Items they want
4. Trade:
   - Sell excess crops for metal parts
   - Buy fuel for return journey
   - Check faction reputation (affects prices)

**Price Formula**: `final_price = base_price × (1 + reputation_modifier)`

- Reputation >20: 10% discount
- Reputation <-20: 20% markup

#### Day 7: Return Home

1. Travel back to farm (same costs)
2. Check crops (should be growing)
3. Read first journal entry (auto-generated)
4. Plan next harvest

## Key Concepts

### Soil Memory

**Each tile remembers**:
- Crops planted
- Years used
- Mood (neutral → content → resentful → exhausted)

**Effects**:
- **Content**: +10% yield
- **Resentful**: -20% yield
- **Exhausted**: -30% yield

**Solution**: Rotate crops. Plant different crops each year.

### Biomechanical vs Biological Crops

**Biomechanical** (Ironwheat, Steamroot):
- Pushes **Order** entropy
- Favors ferro-soil
- Requires metal parts

**Biological** (Pure crops):
- Pushes **Wild** entropy
- Favors pure bio-soil
- Requires organic fertilizer

### Faction Reputation

**Effects**:
- Trade prices
- Marriage opportunities
- NPC opinions
- Settlement access

**Improve**: Complete contracts, honor obligations, generous deeds

**Degrade**: Break contracts, betrayals, shame events
