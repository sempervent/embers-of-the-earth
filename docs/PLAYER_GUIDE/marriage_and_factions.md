### Marriage Contracts

**Dowries**: Resource payment to faction (if required)

**Obligations**: Ongoing commitments (tribute, apprenticeship, service)

**Benefits**: Faction access, better trade prices, heirloom gifts

**Permanent**: Contracts cannot be broken without shame

**[FIELD NOTE]**

*Marriage contracts are permanent. Breaking an oath causes shame that echoes through generations. NPCs remember. Choose factions carefully.*

---

## Faction Reputation

### Reputation Range

**Scale**: -100 (hate) to +100 (love)

**Display**: Shown in faction menu

**Effects**:
- **Positive (>20)**: Friendly dialogue, better trade prices, marriage offers

---

### Reputation Changes

---

### Inheritance

**Shame**: Broken contracts pass to next generation (never fully recover)

---

## Contract Obligations

### Tribute

**Types**: Annual resource payments (grain, metal scrap, fuel)

**Frequency**: Once per year

**Failure**: Reputation -10 per missed payment

**Strategy**: Stockpile resources before tribute due date

---

### Service

---

## Breaking Contracts

### Consequences

**Reputation**: Faction opinion -30 (permanent, never fully recovers)

**NPC Memory**: NPCs remember broken contracts across generations

**Future Contracts**: Broken faction may refuse future contracts

**Recovery**: Generous deeds reduce shame over generations (never fully recover)

---

### When to Break

**Only If Necessary**:
- Extinction risk (no heirs, must marry another faction)
- Faction collapse (contract voided automatically)

**Never Lightly**:
- Shame persists forever
- NPCs remember
- Reputation never fully recovers

---

## If X Then Y Playbook

### If Faction Refuses Marriage

**Reputation Too Low**:
- Complete contracts (improve reputation)
- Generous deeds (+5 per deed)
- Wait for reputation to improve

**Faction Incompatible**:
- Choose different faction (if possible)
- Accept limitation (can't marry that faction)
- Build reputation with compatible faction

---

### If Can't Honor Obligations

**Resource Scarcity**:
- Trade for required resources (if possible)
- Accept reputation penalty (-10 per failure)
- Consider breaking contract (if desperate)

**Service Requirements**:
- Plan service before critical events
- Accept time commitment (2-5 years)
- Break contract (last resort, permanent shame)

---

### If Grandfather's Shame Haunts You

**Inherited Shame**:
- Accept shame (can't change past)
- Generous deeds reduce shame over generations
- Focus on other factions (if possible)

**Recovery**:
- Never fully recover (shame persists)
- Can reduce impact (generous deeds)
- Build reputation with other factions

---

### If Faction Collapses

**World Event**:
- Contract voided automatically
- Reputation resets to neutral
- Marry other faction (if accessible)

**Recovery**:
- Accept loss (faction gone)
- Build relationships with remaining factions

---

## Advanced Diplomacy Tips

### Multi-Faction Strategy

**Advantage**: Access to multiple settlement economies

**Trade-off**: May conflict with faction values (machinists vs Root Keepers)

**Strategy**: Balance relationships (don't commit too hard to one faction)

---

### Marriage Timing

**Early Marriage**:
- Advantage: Early children, backup heirs
- Disadvantage: May limit future faction choices

**Late Marriage**:
- Advantage: More faction options, better reputation
- Disadvantage: Late heirs (extinction risk)

**Strategy**: Marry by age 35 (balance of both)

---

### Contract Negotiation

**Current System**: No explicit negotiation

**Future Expansion**: May add negotiation mechanics

**Current Effect**: Contracts are fixed (accept or reject)
