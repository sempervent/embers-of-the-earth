---

## At a Glance

This guide covers essential survival mechanics: food/water/steam management, weather events, injury treatment, winter preparation, and contingency planning. The wasteland is hostile. Preparation is key.

---

## Resource Management

### Food

**Consumption**: 1 food per day (base)

**Sources**:
- Crop harvests (grain, vegetables)
- Settlement trade
- Preserved food (trade item)
- Production recipes (flour, bread)

**Minimum Stockpile**: 50+ before winter

**Warning**: Zero food → starvation → death

**[FIELD NOTE]**

*Harvest 50 crops before Day 60 (first winter). Trade excess for preserved food. Never let inventory reach zero.*

---

### Water

**Consumption**: 1 water per day (base)

**Sources**:
- Well/rain collection (automatic)
- Settlement trade
- Production recipes (steam → water)

**Minimum Stockpile**: 30+ before winter

**Note**: Water less critical than food (easier to acquire)

---

### Fuel

**Consumption**: 2 fuel per travel day

**Sources**:
- Settlement trade (coal, wood)
- Production recipes (refine scrap → fuel)
- Harvests (if crop yields fuel)

**Minimum Stockpile**: 30+ before winter

**Warning**: Zero fuel → can't travel (stuck until rescue or walk)

---

### Steam Energy

**Consumption**: Powers machines/buildings

**Sources**:
- Steam boiler (fuel + water → steam)
- Production recipes

**Minimum Stockpile**: 20+ for active buildings

**Note**: Required for mills, presses, advanced buildings

---

## Weather Events

### Ashfall

**Frequency**: 10-20% chance per year

**Effects**:
- Reduces visibility (travel slower)
- Silences sounds (audio muted)
- Crop damage (5-10% yield loss)

**Preparation**:
- Harvest crops early (if possible)
- Stockpile extra food
- Delay travel until ashfall ends

**[FIELD NOTE]**

*Ashfall is atmospheric, not deadly. It slows travel and damages crops. Wait it out if possible.*

---

### Storms

**Frequency**: 5-10% chance per year

**Effects**:
- Crop damage (10-20% yield loss)
- Building damage (if unprotected)
- Travel delay (can't travel during storm)

**Preparation**:
- Repair buildings before storm season
- Harvest vulnerable crops early
- Stockpile extra resources

---

### Heat Waves

**Frequency**: 5% chance per year

**Effects**:
- Increased water consumption (+50%)
- Crop stress (reduced growth speed)
- Building overheat (reduced efficiency)

**Preparation**:
- Stockpile extra water
- Delay planting heat-sensitive crops
- Reduce building production

---

### Drought

**Frequency**: 3% chance per year (rare event)

**Effects**:
- Zero water collection for 30+ days
- Crop failure (all crops die)
- Settlement price spikes (+50%)

**Preparation**:
- Stockpile 100+ water before drought season
- Trade for preserved food
- Accept crop loss (can't prevent)

---

## Injury System

### Injury Types

**Cuts** (minor):
- Death probability +5%
- Reduced Vigor (-2)
- Duration: 7-14 days
- Treatment: Rest at settlement (reduces duration)

**Bruises** (minor):
- Reduced Resolve (-2)
- Duration: 3-7 days
- Treatment: Rest (natural recovery)

**Serious Cuts** (major):
- Death probability +15%
- Reduced Vigor (-5), Resolve (-3)
- Duration: 14-30 days
- Treatment: Settlement healer (costs resources, reduces duration)

**Exhaustion** (temporary):
- Reduced all stats (-2)
- Duration: Until rested
- Treatment: Rest at settlement or home

---

### Injury Prevention

**During Travel**:
- Choose safe routes (lower encounter rate)
- Pay tribute to bandits (avoid combat)
- Use Diplomacy stat for negotiation
- Avoid machine-beast encounters (if possible)

**During Hazards**:
- Pass stat tests (Resolve, Vigor, Diplomacy)
- Choose safe options (pay, flee)
- Accept resource loss (better than injury)

---

### Injury Treatment

**At Settlement**:
1. Visit healer NPC (if available)
2. Pay treatment cost (varies by injury severity)
3. Rest for 1-3 days
4. Injury duration reduced (faster recovery)

**At Home**:
- Rest naturally (slower recovery)
- No cost, but takes longer
- Serious injuries may not fully heal

---

## Winter Preparation

### First Winter (Days 61-120)

**Start Prep**: Day 30 (before winter)

**Essential Checklist**:
- [ ] 50+ food stockpiled
- [ ] 30+ fuel stockpiled
- [ ] 30+ water stockpiled
- [ ] Tools repaired (if damaged)
- [ ] Buildings operational (if built)
- [ ] Faction relations stable (for trade access)

**Winter Activities**:
- Production (buildings, recipes)
- Trade (settlements still accessible)
- Marriage planning (if faction relations allow)
- Exploration (visit new settlements)

---

### Subsequent Winters

**Prep Timeline**: Start 30 days before winter

**Enhanced Checklist**:
- [ ] 100+ food (if family grown)
- [ ] 50+ fuel (if traveling frequently)
- [ ] 50+ water (if buildings active)
- [ ] Heirlooms secured (can be stolen)
- [ ] Faction contracts honored
- [ ] Production queues planned

---

## Contingency Plans

### If You Run Out of Food

**Emergency Protocol**:
1. Travel to nearest settlement immediately
2. Trade crops/tools for food
3. If no crops: trade heirlooms (last resort)
4. Return home before starvation

**Prevention**: Always maintain 20+ food buffer

---

### If You Run Out of Fuel

**Emergency Protocol**:
1. Walk to nearest settlement (slower, consumes food)
2. Trade crops for fuel
3. If no settlement nearby: soft fail (stuck until rescue)

**Prevention**: Always maintain 20+ fuel buffer

---

### If Crops Fail

**Emergency Protocol**:
1. Check soil memory (may be resentful)
2. Replant different crop (rotate crops)
3. Trade for seeds (if no seeds)
4. Accept yield loss (if soil exhausted)

**Prevention**: Rotate crops, manage soil memory

---

### If Building Breaks

**Emergency Protocol**:
1. Check building status (damaged/unrepaired)
2. Repair with metal parts
3. If no parts: trade for parts
4. Accept production loss (if can't repair)

**Prevention**: Repair buildings before winter

---

### If Faction Relationship Breaks

**Emergency Protocol**:
1. Check memory events (what caused the break?)
2. Complete generous deeds (rebuild reputation)
3. Accept shame if grandfather's fault (can't fully recover)
4. Focus on other factions (if possible)

**Prevention**: Honor contracts, avoid betrayals

---

## If X Then Y Playbook

### If Weather Event Triggers

**Ashfall**:
- Wait it out (can't prevent)
- Harvest vulnerable crops early
- Stockpile extra food

**Storm**:
- Harvest early (if possible)
- Repair buildings
- Delay travel

**Heat Wave**:
- Stockpile extra water
- Reduce building production
- Delay heat-sensitive crops

**Drought**:
- Stockpile 100+ water before drought season
- Trade for preserved food
- Accept crop loss (can't prevent)

---

### If Injury Occurs

**Minor Injury** (cuts, bruises):
- Rest at settlement (faster recovery)
- Or rest at home (slower but free)
- Continue activities (with stat penalties)

**Major Injury** (serious cuts):
- Visit healer immediately (prevents death)
- Pay treatment cost
- Rest 2-3 days
- Reduce activity until healed

**Multiple Injuries**:
- Death probability increases significantly
- Prioritize treatment
- Reduce risky activities

---

### If Resources Critically Low

**Food <10**:
- Travel to settlement immediately
- Trade for food
- Return home before starvation

**Fuel <10**:
- Walk to nearest settlement (if possible)
- Trade for fuel
- If stuck: soft fail (wait for rescue)

**Water <10**:
- Trade for water immediately
- Reduce building production (saves water)
- Wait for rain/well (if possible)

---

## Advanced Survival Tips

### Stockpile Management

**Golden Ratio**: 2:1:1 (food:fuel:water)

**Example**: 100 food, 50 fuel, 50 water

**Reasoning**: Food most critical, fuel for travel, water for production

---

### Crop Rotation Strategy

**Year 1**: Plant Ironwheat on ferro-soil tiles  
**Year 2**: Plant Steamroot on same tiles  
**Year 3**: Rest tiles (or plant biological crops)

**Effect**: Prevents soil exhaustion, maintains yields

---

### Building Efficiency

**Steam Boiler**: Always running (generates energy)  
**Mill**: Only when grain stockpiled (processes crops)  
**Press**: Only when seeds available (extracts oil)

**Strategy**: Build buildings when resources stockpiled, not before
