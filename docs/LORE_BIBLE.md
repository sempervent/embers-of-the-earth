## At a Glance

The world of Embers of the Earth exists in a post-apocalyptic steampunk setting where machines and nature war beneath the earth. This document establishes the setting, factions, timeline, and canonical elements that shape the player's experience.

---

## Timeline

### Pre-Fall Era

The Old World built vast mechanical cities, steam-powered machinery, and biomechanical agriculture. The machine-god slept beneath the earth, worshipped by cults of engineers.

### The Fall (Year 0)

A great silence. The machines stopped. The machine-god stirred. Cities fell. Ash filled the sky for decades.

### The Ash Years (Years 1-50)

Survivors scattered. Some clung to machines, believing they would wake again. Others rejected metal entirely, seeking pure soil and biological crops. Settlements formed around factions.

### Present Day (Years 50+)

The current era. Factions have stabilized. Trade routes exist. Marriages seal alliances. The machine-god still stirs. Nature pushes back. Players inhabit this fragile balance.
