## Credits

### Development Team

**Lead Developer** — Joshua Grant  
*"The soil remembers. The bloodline continues. The legacy is written."*

**Systems Design** — Joshua Grant  
*"Every system connects. The farm feeds the settlements. The settlements trade with factions. The factions remember your bloodline."*

**Narrative Design** — Joshua Grant  
*"The story emerges from player choices, NPC memories, rumors, and world events. Each playthrough tells a different tale."*

**Audio Design** — Joshua Grant  
*"Music adapts. The soundtrack shifts with entropy. Order brings mechanical drones. Wild brings organic melodies."*

**Art Direction** — Joshua Grant  
*"The palette is muted: copper, ash, soot, brass. The style is pixel art: functional, worn, honest."*
